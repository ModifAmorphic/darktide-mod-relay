# Architecture

Mod Relay launches Darktide modded via DLL injection — no game-directory
footprint, no bundle-database patching — and stays out of the way for vanilla
play (launch from Steam = the unmodified game).

## Component model

- **Mod Relay (runtime) (`src/`)**: the injected modding runtime + its
  launcher. A Rust discovery pure-library + a C live-game shell, linked into
  one DLL, delivered by `CreateRemoteThread`; the C shell stages the **mod
  loader** — the runtime-controlled Lua loader that loads DMF + user mods. See
  `docs/architecture/MOD-RELAY.md` for the full subcomponent breakdown.
- **DMF + user mods** (Lua, not our code): the Darktide-Mod-Framework Lua
  files, preserved as-is; only the harness is replaced. Loaded by the mod
  loader at runtime, from the user-controlled mod root (`--mod-path`) —
  distinct from the Relay-controlled loader root (the two-path split; see
  `docs/architecture/MOD_LOADER-DMF.md`).

## The Relay runtime — the Hybrid

The Relay runtime is a **Hybrid**: a Rust pure-library for discovery + a C
shell for everything that touches the live game, linked into one DLL. Each
language is placed where its benefit holds:

- **Rust discovery (`src/discovery/`)** — a pure library (no I/O, no global
  state) that takes a PE image as `&[u8]` and returns the 16 LuaJIT function
  addresses. 100% safe Rust in core logic; offline-testable against a binary
  fixture. Compiled to a C-ABI staticlib.
- **C shell (`src/shell/`)** — the injected DLL: `DllMain` worker, MinHook on
  `lua_newstate` (VM capture) + `lua_pcall` (the production trampoline), the
  C-ABI seam call into Rust. The irreducibly-unsafe live-game bits, where C's
  native ergonomics + domain track record apply.

### The seam

The Rust↔C boundary is a tiny C-ABI surface: `relay_discover` /
`relay_discover_detail` (and the test-only `relay_test_panic_boundary`,
gated behind the `test-hooks` Cargo feature and the C-side `RELAY_TEST_HOOKS`
macro). It's held at the safety boundary — Rust owns stateless computation; C
owns everything touching the live game. The shared contract is the
`RelayAddressTable` struct (`#[repr(C)]`, mirrored in
`src/shell/include/relay_discovery.h`) + return codes.

### Panic boundary

Every `extern "C"` entry point wraps its body in `catch_unwind` (primary
containment — a panic in the pure-lib is caught at the seam and returned as a
sentinel, no UB crossing into C). `panic = "unwind"` for the linked build; a
separate `panic-abort` profile is the fail-safe backstop. (`catch_unwind` and
`panic=abort` are mutually exclusive per-build, so the unwind build links and
the abort profile is a separate demonstration.)

### Launcher flow (`src/launcher/`)

`CreateProcess(Darktide.exe, CREATE_SUSPENDED)` → `VirtualAllocEx` +
`WriteProcessMemory` (DLL path) → `CreateRemoteThread(LoadLibraryA, dllpath)`
→ **wait for the `relay_hook_ready` named event** → `ResumeThread`.

The hook-ready wait is essential: `DllMain` returns instantly (it only spawns
a worker), and the worker doesn't enable the `lua_newstate` hook until after
discovery — resuming before the hook is ready means the engine calls
`lua_newstate` before the hook is installed. The launcher also sets
`SteamAppId=1361210` + `SteamGameId=1361210` in the child env so the correct
appID reaches `steamclient`.

### Discovery

All 16 LuaJIT/engine functions are discovered at runtime (no hardcoded
addresses), via two methods + `.pdata` gap handling:
- **Method A — string-anchor**: `stingray::` namespaced strings in `.rdata` →
  LEA cross-references → `.pdata` function (engine functions).
- **Method B — source-pattern**: match compiled function bodies against LuaJIT
  2.1 source (the C API cluster).
- `.pdata` gaps: CFG thunks (`E9 rel32`), leaf functions, import thunks
  (`FF 25`).

The engine is **build-agnostic** — all 16 functions are found at
uniformly-shifted RVAs across binary versions (validated across builds; e.g. a
+0xf0680 cluster shift). The matchers are the ongoing maintenance surface
(re-tune on a LuaJIT version change — rare; LuaJIT is static Stingray code).

## Test strategy

- **Rust** (`cargo test --features test-hooks -p relay-discovery`): unit
  (seam null-arg rejection, panic containment), integration (oracle — all 16
  vs the real `Darktide.exe` via `DARKTIDE_GAME_DIR`; `relay_discover_detail`
  error path; synthetic-PE parsing).
- **C** (`make test`, via wine): SteamAppId env-setting; CreateRemoteThread
  injection + hook-ready handshake + resume against a benign stub process.
- **Mod loader Lua** (`make mod-loader-test`, offline LuaJIT harness — no
  game/wine): the loader + the deferred bootstrap, the IO adaptation, the
  scan/load split, the `Managers.mod` surface, hot reload, final state exit,
  Crashify metadata, lifecycle failure containment, alerts, and exactly-once
  cleanup.
- **Live** (validated end-to-end on Linux/Proton): game reaches the main menu,
  `lua_newstate` hook fires, `L` captured, `lua_gettop(L)=0` (confirms the
  struct offsets in-process), all 16 discovered in-process matching the
  offline oracle; DMF and user mods load, failure/recovery probes and Crashify
  metadata execute, repeated hot reload does not stack, shutdown dispatches the
  final state exit, and normal Steam launch remains vanilla.

## Build

MinGW cross-compile from Linux (`make build`/`check`/`test`) + MSVC native on
Windows (CI). Both gate on `cargo clippy --all-targets --features test-hooks --
-D warnings` + tests. CI: `.github/workflows/pr.yml` (the PR quality gate,
mingw + msvc) + `release-please.yml` (release pipeline, which also builds +
attaches the Windows runtime bundle to each release).

## Production launcher insights (from live testing)

1. **Proton launch model**: Steam non-Steam-game (the launcher) + forced
   Proton + `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH` → launcher creates+suspends+injects. Steam
   UX + zero game-dir footprint + correct hook timing in one design.
2. **Steam appID**: the launcher sets `SteamAppId`/`SteamGameId` to `1361210`
   (otherwise the non-Steam-shortcut's hashed appID denies `SteamAPI_Init`).
3. **Hook-ready handshake**: `CreateProcess(SUSPENDED) → inject → wait for
   hook-ready → ResumeThread` (resuming right after `LoadLibrary` returns is
   too early).
