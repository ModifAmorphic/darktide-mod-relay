# Mod Relay (runtime) — architecture

**Mod Relay (runtime)** is the injected modding runtime + its launcher for
Darktide. It's a **Hybrid** — a Rust discovery pure-library
+ a C live-game shell, linked into one DLL, delivered by `CreateRemoteThread`.
See `docs/architecture/README.md` for the project-wide architecture.

## Subcomponents

### `discovery/` — Rust discovery pure-library  *(built, stable)*

A pure function: a PE image (`&[u8]`) → the 16 LuaJIT/engine function
addresses. No I/O, no global state; 100% safe Rust in core logic;
offline-testable against a binary fixture. Compiled to a C-ABI staticlib.

- **Interface (the seam):** `relay_discover` / `relay_discover_detail`
  (C-ABI). Shared contract: `RelayAddressTable` (`#[repr(C)]`, mirrored in
  `shell/include/relay_discovery.h`) + return codes.
- **State:** production-quality (the Relay runtime seed). The canonical 16
  engine/LuaJIT function addresses are stable.

### `shell/` — C live-game shell (the injected DLL)  *(built; live-validated)*

This is **`relay_shell.dll`** — the C shell linked with the Rust **discovery**
staticlib (`librelay_discovery.a`) + MinHook, into one PE DLL.

The DLL injected into Darktide. `DllMain` spawns a worker that: runs discovery
(via the seam) → installs the two production hooks → stages the trampoline →
signals hook-ready.

- **Two production hooks.** The shell installs exactly two MinHook detours,
  both required (a failure to install either is fatal — the worker exits and
  the launcher's hook-ready wait times out, terminating the game rather than
  resuming half-modded):
  - **`lua_newstate`** — captures the single Lua VM (`g_L`) and emits a
    one-time `lua_gettop(L)=0` structural sanity log (confirms the LJ_64
    non-GC64 struct layout in-process).
  - **`lua_pcall`** — counts calls and runs the staged trampoline exactly
    once at pcall#1, BEFORE the original pcall.
- **Engine-context mechanism (proven).** A chunk injected at the first
  `lua_pcall` (after `luaL_openlibs`, while `io`/`loadstring` are still in
  globals) sees the engine's real facilities and can `io.open` + `loadstring`
  staged Lua — validated end-to-end in the live game. The engine removes
  `io`/`loadstring` from globals by ~pcall#10, so the trampoline runs in the
  pcall#1 → pcall#10 window and captures them first. There is no `setfenv`
  sandbox at pcall#1 (a chunk's env *is* the globals table). **`Managers`** is
  an engine global (appears late in boot); **`CLASS`** is never engine-set, so
  the mod loader sets it.
- **Production trampoline + the mod loader.** The production trampoline is
   wired in `dllmain.c`: on the first `lua_pcall` (one-shot, before the
   engine's pcall) it injects the proven chunk — set the two root globals
   (`MOD_LOADER_DIR` + `RELAY_MOD_PATH`) plus a temporary private handoff of the
   same manifest-derived full product version used by launcher `--version`,
   `io.open` the staged entry
   (`<MOD_LOADER_DIR>/init.lua`) → read → `loadstring` → run. (When the Lua
   print tee is enabled, the trampoline also registers the private
   `__mod_relay_lua_log_sink` callback immediately before loading the chunk —
   see [Logging](#logging); this adds **no new hook**.) The mod loader
  Lua is **packaged with the Relay runtime** (staged into `bin/mod_loader/`
  by `make build`, deployed next to the launcher/DLL; the shell self-locates it
  from its own DLL path as `<dll-dir>\mod_loader\` and publishes that dir as the
  internal `MOD_LOADER_DIR` global — not an env var/flag). The mod root is read
  from `RELAY_MOD_PATH` (the launcher sets it in the child env from
  `--mod-path`); if unset the chunk emits an empty `RELAY_MOD_PATH` (the
  loader runs, finds no mod root, and degrades gracefully — mods won't load, no
  crash). If the loader dir can't be self-located (DLL path unreadable/too
  long), the trampoline is SKIPPED (logged) and the game runs **vanilla**. The
  chunk template and game-safety discipline (one-shot, stack-clean,
  re-entrancy-guarded) are unchanged.
- **Built + live-validated (the full modding chain).** The mod loader
  (`src/mod_loader/init.lua`, the runtime-staged entry) runs in
  engine-context at pcall#1, captures the engine's real
  `io`/`loadstring`/`require`/`print`/`os` into the `Mods` table **before
  the engine removes `io`/`loadstring` (~pcall#6)**, publishes the engine LuaJIT
  FFI module via the pre-wrap module loader (`Mods.original_require("ffi")`,
  since `require("ffi")` creates no global in LuaJIT 2.1), and bridges pcall#1 to the
  engine's late boot via a **deferred bootstrap**:
  - the **require bridge** (`require_bridge.lua`) preserves the engine's real
    `require` (as `Mods.original_require`), wraps global `require` to record
    each distinct table result in `Mods.require_store` (identity-deduped, for
    DMF's `hook_require`), and calls the lifecycle coordinator after every
    successful require;
  - the **class registry** (`class_registry.lua`) is installed once by the
    coordinator the moment the engine's global `class` appears. It wraps
    `class()` so every class object is recorded in the `CLASS` table. Missing
    keys return the unresolved name as a **string sentinel** (e.g.
    `CLASS.InputService == "InputService"` before the class is registered) so
    official DMF's string/table hook validator accepts `dmf:hook_safe(CLASS.X,
    …)` calls issued before the class exists and queues them as delayed hooks;
    `rawget(CLASS, name)` still returns nil for unresolved classes so the
    lifecycle's readiness checks treat them as absent. Each registered class is
    also mirrored to `_G[name]` (rawget-guarded so explicit engine/DMF
    assignments are preserved) for mod compatibility (mods cache class globals
    like `_G.Promise`, which the engine defines via `class("Promise")` in
    `scripts/foundation/utilities/promise.lua` but does not publish to `_G`);
  - the **lifecycle** (`lifecycle.lua`) coordinator then directly
    closure-wraps `BootStateRequireGameScripts._state_update` exactly once it
    exists. That wrapper calls the original first (preserving its returns,
    never swallowing its errors), then a protected `advance_bootstrap` that —
    with per-step retry/idempotency — loads the loader driver
    (`mod_manager.lua`, which itself loads the DMF adapter
    `dmf_adapter.lua` from the loader root), instantiates `Managers.mod`, and
    directly closure-wraps `StateGame.update` + `GameStateMachine._change_state`
    + `GameStateMachine.destroy` (no generic hook API, no loadstring-generated
    hook chain, no string-path deferred queue). The `destroy` wrapper dispatches
    one final `on_game_state_changed("exit", …)` for the active state before
    destruction (deduplicated against `_change_state` per state machine).
  The loader splits load into two phases: `init()` SCANs (reads `mods.lst`,
    builds the `_mods` table — the order file is authoritative, the loader
    injects nothing — restores persisted manager settings via the adapter, and
    registers the DMF IO observer via the adapter; no mod loaded), and the first
    `StateGame.update` tick LOADs (per-mod `run()` → nil/table validation →
    optional object `init()`, then
    `_state="done"` via the adapter) — deferred so boot-complete globals like
    `Managers.input` exist. Every `update` tick also polls the developer-mode-
    gated hot-reload shortcut (LEFT Ctrl + LEFT Shift + R) and drives the
    reload state machine: a request is consumed at the start of an update into a
    teardown frame (`on_reload` forward → `on_unload` reverse → retire stale DMF
    generation globals → reread authoritative `mods.lst`), then the next update
    loads the new generation in order (`init(reload_data_for_name)` per mod) and
    publishes `done` — non-transactional best-effort, no shadow load/rollback.
    The same `ModManager` instance, `_settings` table, require store, `CLASS`,
    file service/observer, and `Managers.dmf.persistent_tables` survive every
    generation. The file observer adapts DMF's mod-facing IO at the mod root
    mid-DMF-init (after `core/io.lua` appears, before Phase 2) and re-adapts
    each DMF generation across reload — tracking both the `DMFMod` table
    identity and the exact Relay-installed `io_dofile` wrapper, so a reused
    class table whose methods were overwritten by the new `core/io.lua` is
    correctly re-adapted (not silently left on stock `./../mods`). Stock-DMF-specific
    integration — persisted `_settings` restoration, the DMF-visible contract
    fields (`_settings.developer_mode`, `_state`, `_mod_load_index`), DMF-required
    entry-shape validation, the eight `DMFMod:io_*` overrides, and stale-
    generation-global retirement — is centralized in `dmf_adapter.lua`;
    `mod_manager.lua` stays generic and drives those through the adapter's
    transition methods. Successful `run()` calls accept only nil (DMF-driven)
    or a table (outer-driven); malformed values fail only their entry and both
    initial/replacement attempts finalize unconditionally. Accepted descriptors
    publish guarded per-generation `Mod:<name> = true` Crashify metadata, while
    the private version snapshot publishes process-lifetime
    `ModRelay:Version` exactly once and is never removed during reload.
    The first escaped outer `init`/`update`/state-change error disables and
    best-effort unloads that entry for the generation. If the escaped outer
    boundary is `dmf`, Relay stops and reverse-cleans all current outer objects
    without inspecting or blaming DMF-managed inner mods. Guarded engine-event
    alerts remain active at a controlled cadence until restart or completed
    user-requested hot reload; they do not depend on DMF or expose
    `Mods.message`. The loader exposes itself as `Managers.mod`. Bootstrap setup
    remains pcall-contained so an infrastructure failure degrades to vanilla +
    a log line rather than crashing the game. **Baseline live validation:** the
    pre-hardening independently-reimplemented loader plus the extracted DMF
    adapter completed the observed startup/load
    chain on 2026-07-14 — the operator launched through Mod Curator, the
    game started, and DMF + user mods loaded as expected from the configured mod
    root. Repeated in-game hot reload (LEFT Ctrl + LEFT Shift + R) was validated
    in the same session: clean completions for generations 2, 3, and 4 (keyboard
    requests, DMF `on_reload`/`on_unload` each generation, mods reinitializing),
    with no `./../mods`, localization-return, framework-failure, or
    degraded/restart-recommended errors in Darktide's console log. Not claimed by
    this run: the new Crashify metadata, alert transport, lifecycle failure
    paths, behavior across every possible mod, or repeated reload under
    arbitrarily long sessions. Those new paths pass offline and still require
    operator live acceptance.** The offline LuaJIT harness
    (`make mod-loader-test`) covers the logic. See
    `docs/architecture/MOD_LOADER-DMF.md` for the DMF integration + the IO
    adaptation + the load timing + the [hot-reload](../docs/architecture/MOD_LOADER-DMF.md#hot-reload)
    contract.
- **Bootstrap-only C helpers.** C functions are acceptable only at the
  bootstrap boundary (crossing from DLL injection into the Lua lifecycle) or
  for runtime-private plumbing (status/log) — never as loader/DMF/mod-visible
  replacements for engine Lua facilities (`require`, `io`, …). See the
  compatibility section below.

### `launcher/` — C injector  *(built)*

This is **`mod_relay.exe`** — the C injector (`src/launcher/`), the
process that creates the game suspended, injects the shell, and resumes it.
`CreateProcess(Darktide.exe, SUSPENDED)`
→ inject `relay_shell.dll` → wait for `relay_hook_ready` → `ResumeThread` →
exit. Sets `SteamAppId`/`SteamGameId`.

- **Built:** injection + hook-ready handshake + Steam appID.
- **Interface (the CLI):** a **flag-based CLI**, where every setting
  follows **flag > env var > default**. `--game-binary` is the only required
  flag; the shell DLL is hardcoded next to the launcher (the shell self-locates
  the mod loader from its path), and the log file defaults next to the launcher
  exe.

  | Flag | Env var | Default |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `--game-binary <path>` | `RELAY_GAME_BINARY` | — **(required)** |
  | `--mod-path <path>` | `RELAY_MOD_PATH` | unset (mods won't load) |
  | `--log-file <path>` | `RELAY_LOG_FILE` | `<launcher-dir>\relay.log` |
  | `--log-level <level>` | `RELAY_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` (`error`/`warn`/`info`/`debug`/`trace`) |
  | `--steam-app-id <id>` | `RELAY_STEAM_APP_ID` | `1361210` |
  | `--lua-logs` | `RELAY_LUA_LOGS=1` | off (value-less; only the exact env value `1` enables) |
  | `--` (separator) | — (none) | unset (rest-of-line forwarded to the game, in order) |
  | `--version` | — (none) | — (value-less; prints the build-injected version and exits 0) |

  The injected DLL (`relay_shell.dll`) is hardcoded to `<launcher-dir>\` and
  self-locates the mod loader (`<dll-dir>\mod_loader\`); neither path is
  configurable. The launcher resolves the config, then publishes the
  shell-contract values (`SteamAppId`/`SteamGameId`, `RELAY_MOD_PATH`,
  `RELAY_LOG_FILE`, `RELAY_LOG_LEVEL`, and — only when enabled —
  `RELAY_LUA_LOGS=1`) into the child env before `CreateProcess`, so the
  injected shell inherits them. `RELAY_LUA_LOGS` is canonicalized: the launcher
  sets it to exactly `1` when the resolved config enables the Lua print tee
  (`--lua-logs` or `RELAY_LUA_LOGS=1`), and **removes** it (not set to `0`)
  when disabled, so a stale parent value cannot leak into the child as a
  non-`1`. Game arguments are NOT published to the env — they go on the child
  command line: the quoted exe as argv[0] (byte-for-byte the legacy form),
  followed by every token after the end-of-options `--` separator, each
  rendered with the MSVC CRT quoting algorithm. A bare `--` ends option
  parsing; Relay's own flags must precede it, and a flag-looking token after
  `--` is a raw game arg (no `--` is the legacy exe-only launch). The command
  line is ANSI only (active code page; Darktide args are ASCII) and capped at
  `RELAY_CMDLINE_MAX` (32,767 chars incl. NUL — the `CreateProcessA` ceiling);
  oversize is rejected before any process is created. `-h`/`--help` prints the
  full table.

## Contracts

### Launcher invocation (the external interface)

The launcher is a standalone CLI — run it from a shell, or invoke it from an
app (it's the runtime that powers Mod Curator, but any caller works).
`--game-binary` is required; the rest is flag > env > default (full table in
`launcher/` above).

- **Two roots:** the mod loader Lua (`init.lua` + its modules) ships WITH the
  runtime — `make build` stages it into `bin/mod_loader/`, deployed next to
  the launcher/DLL. The shell self-locates the loader root from its own DLL
  path (`<dll-dir>\mod_loader\`, set as the internal `MOD_LOADER_DIR` global
  — not an env var/flag). The **mod path** (`--mod-path` /
  `RELAY_MOD_PATH`) is yours: point it at the directory that **contains**
  your `mods/` subdirectory (the "boundary" — DMF + user mods + `mods.lst`
  live at `<mod_path>/mods/`). The trampoline sets `RELAY_MOD_PATH` from
  it; the loader derives `Mods._mod_root` as `<mod_path>/mods` (what
  `Mods.file.*` roots at) and uses `Mods._mod_path` as the containment
  boundary for the `Mods.lua.io` raw-read wrapper (see
  `docs/architecture/MOD_LOADER-DMF.md` → "Raw `Mods.lua.io` redirection").
- **`mods.lst`** is a plain text file you author (or your app generates): one
  mod folder name per line, in load order. It is **the Relay↔caller load-order
  contract** — the mod loader reads it authoritatively and loads exactly the
  listed mods in order; it injects nothing (DMF does not read it). When DMF is
  used it **must be listed first** (the loader makes no framework assumption;
  DMF is first only because `mods.lst` says so). Missing/empty → no mod loads
  (graceful). Relay uses `mods.lst` exclusively — it has no use for the
  community toolchain's `mod_load_order.txt`.
- **Not the runtime's job:** load-order computation, dependency resolution,
  profile/staging management. You handle those — by hand, or in the app
  driving the launcher. The runtime is the conduit.
- **Platform:** Windows — run the launcher directly, Steam in the background.
  Linux — Steam → launcher (Proton, Darktide's compatdata) → Darktide, one
  prefix/context. (See the root `README.md` getting-started for a `launch.bat`
  + Steam non-Steam-game setup.)

### Internal

- **discovery ↔ shell:** the C-ABI seam (`relay_discover` /
  `relay_discover_detail`); the panic boundary (`catch_unwind` at every
  `extern "C"` entry, `panic = "abort"` fail-safe).
- **launcher ↔ shell:** the `relay_hook_ready` named-event handshake (hook
  armed before `main`).

### Env-var contract (shell ↔ launcher)

The source of truth for the values the launcher publishes into the child env
and the injected shell reads. (The launcher's own config-override env vars are
in the CLI table above; these are the *contract* the shell depends on.) The
loader root is **not** here — the shell self-locates it from its own DLL path
(`<dll-dir>\mod_loader\`) and publishes it to Lua as the internal `MOD_LOADER_DIR`
global, so no loader-path env var exists.

| Env var | Set by | Read by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RELAY_MOD_PATH` | launcher (only when `--mod-path`/env configured) | shell trampoline + mod loader | the **mod-path boundary** — a directory that *contains* a `mods/` subdirectory where DMF + user mods + `mods.lst` live. The trampoline sets `RELAY_MOD_PATH` from it; the loader derives `Mods._mod_root` as `<mod_path>/mods` (`Mods.file.*` roots here) and `Mods._mod_path` as the containment boundary for the `Mods.lua.io` wrapper. Unset ⇒ empty `RELAY_MOD_PATH` (mods won't load; graceful). |
| `RELAY_LOG_FILE` | launcher | shell | shell log file path |
| `RELAY_LOG_LEVEL` | launcher | shell | shell log level (`error`/`warn`/`info`/`debug`/`trace`) |
| `RELAY_LUA_LOGS` | launcher (canonicalized) | shell worker | the **Lua print tee** switch: only the exact value `1` enables. The launcher sets `RELAY_LUA_LOGS=1` when the resolved config enables it (`--lua-logs` or the env `1` itself), and **removes** it when disabled (never `0`/`true`/etc.). The shell snapshots it once at worker startup (`env_is_exact_one`); any other value (unset/empty/`0`/`true`/oversized) is off. Direct shell injectors may set `RELAY_LUA_LOGS=1` themselves — that is the external non-launcher contract. |
| `SteamAppId` / `SteamGameId` | launcher | Steam | the real Darktide app id (`1361210`); without it `SteamAPI_Init` is denied under a non-Steam shortcut |

### Logging

The shell's C-side log is **`relay.log`**. Each line is structured
`<local ts+UTC offset> <LEVEL> <component>: <msg>` (e.g.
`2026-07-16T12:34:56-04:00 INFO  trampoline: @ pcall#1: OK`) and goes to both
`OutputDebugString` and the log file. The timestamp is **local time with an
ISO-8601 UTC offset** that follows the system time zone (UTC itself shows
`+00:00`; no `Z` special case). Level-filtered via
`RELAY_LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`; crank to `debug`/`trace` for
verbose detail). Default location is next to the launcher exe (resolved by the
launcher from `--log-file`/`RELAY_LOG_FILE`); the shell itself opens
`RELAY_LOG_FILE` if set, otherwise falls back to beside the game exe.

Right after the startup banner, the worker logs a `launching <cmdline>` INFO
line — the host process command line as the game sees it (the quoted exe + the
forwarded game args, e.g. `"…\Darktide.exe" --lua-heap-mb-size 2048`), so the
exact arguments that reached the game are captured.

**Log split to be aware of:** the mod loader's Lua-side `print`/`__print` output
(the `[mod_loader] …` lines), DMF, and mods all go to the **engine's** print
destination — Darktide's **console log** (`console-*.log`, at
`%APPDATA%\Fatshark\Darktide\console_logs\` on Windows, or
`<compatdata>/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Fatshark/Darktide/console_logs/`
under Proton) — **not** to the Proton `steam-$APPID.log` (which captures
Wine/Proton diagnostics only). `relay.log` carries the C-side shell + trampoline
lines (including the trampoline's one-line `OK`/`FAIL` status, which is the
reliable bootstrap validation).

**Optional Lua print tee (`--lua-logs` / `RELAY_LUA_LOGS=1`, default off).**
When enabled, Relay additionally copies Lua `print` / `__print` output into
`relay.log` as structured `INFO  lua-print:` lines. It is a **tee, never a
redirect**: the engine's console `print` still runs first and authoritatively,
and the tee only adds `relay.log` copies of what traverses those wrapped
surfaces. Coverage is honest and narrower than "all Lua logs":

- **Captured:** `print` / `__print` calls made after the wrapper installs at
  pcall#1 — Relay loader output, and any DMF/mod path routed through those
  globals.
- **Not captured:** a `print` reference captured before Relay wraps the
  globals, DMF/mod APIs that bypass those globals, native/engine/Wine/Proton
  output, or every `console-*.log` line. DMF `mod:info`/`warning`/`error`
  coverage depends on whether their runtime path ultimately calls the wrapped
  globals (observed, not guaranteed).

Because captured lines are `INFO`, `RELAY_LOG_LEVEL=warn`/`error` filters them
out of `relay.log` while the console log is unaffected. The wrapper is
process-lifetime and non-stacking; see
`docs/architecture/MOD_LOADER-DMF.md` for the `print` / `__print` surface
contract.

**Native sink (no new hook).** The tee adds **no new MinHook detour** — the
production hook count stays exactly two (`lua_newstate` + `lua_pcall`). The
sink is a private C callback registered directly in `trampoline_run`, BEFORE
the staged chunk loads/ runs, using RVAs already in the discovered address
table:

- `lua_pushcclosure(L, &cb, 0)` pushes one zero-upvalue closure;
- `lua_setfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "__mod_relay_lua_log_sink")` sets it as a
  **temporary private global** (`LUA_GLOBALSINDEX = -10002`, grounded against
  `/usr/include/luajit-2.1/lua.h` for LuaJIT 2.1 / Lua 5.1; `lua_setglobal` is
  a macro over this `setfield`). Zero net stack effect (`+1` push, `−1` setfield
  pop), so the chunk still loads at the same base.

The closure (`lua_log_sink_cb`) expects exactly one Lua string (`lua_type`
guards; non-string/wrong-arity calls are ignored, never errored), reads it with
`lua_tolstring` + explicit length, and never calls back into Lua or retains the
pointer. `init.lua` snapshots the closure into a **private local** and clears
the global **before its idempotency guard**, so community code never sees it. It
is runtime-private logging plumbing — **not** a mod API (`Mods.log`,
`Mods.message`, etc. are deliberately absent).

The line-sanitization policy lives in the pure, I/O-free helper `log_sink.c`
(declared `log_sink.h`; unit-tested directly by `tests/test_log_sink.c`, the
same compile-the-impl pattern as `trampoline.c`):

- **4096-byte input budget** per sink call (`LOG_SINK_INPUT_BUDGET`); input
  past that is dropped after exactly **one** trailing truncation-marker line.
- **768-byte output chunks** (`LOG_SINK_LINE_BUDGET`); a longer physical line
  is emitted as consecutive width-bounded lines, each with its own prefix.
- **CR/LF/CRLF splitting** (CRLF is one break); empty lines are emitted
  faithfully.
- **`\xNN` escaping** for control bytes `0x00-0x1f` (except the terminators)
  and `0x7f` (DEL) — so embedded NUL cannot terminate a buffer and no control
  byte can forge line structure. `%` and UTF-8 bytes (`0x80-0xff`) pass through
  unchanged as data.
- **No format-string exposure:** the emit bridge uses a literal `"%.*s\n"`
  with the sanitized line as the data argument, so a `%` in the data is
  literal.
- **Fixed buffers, no heap** proportional to the input string; bounded stack.
- **Logger-wide SRW lock** (`g_log_lock`) serializes the `OutputDebugStringA` +
  file-write pair so worker-thread and Lua-thread (sink) lines never interleave
  mid-line. The sink does not take the lock itself (it reaches `relay_log` via
  the emit bridge, and the lock is non-reentrant).

Any failure (malformed value, missing optional C-API pointer, sink error)
degrades silently to console-only behavior; mod loading is never blocked.

## Runtime patch compatibility

The entire point of Mod Relay is to eliminate the fragility of the
bundle-db / `patch_999` toolchain — not to relocate that fragility upstream
into a reimplementation of Darktide's Lua runtime.

Mod Relay replaces the current toolchain's bundle-database entry point:

```text
current:    dtkit-patch → patch_999 → mod_loader → DMF → mods
Relay:      DLL injection → runtime patch → staged mod_loader/DMF entry point → mods
```

The runtime patch is an entry-point replacement, not a replacement Lua runtime.
It may use native code and narrow C helpers to cross from DLL injection into the
game's Lua lifecycle, but once staged loader/DMF/mod Lua is running it must see the
same relevant globals, loader behavior, and file/runtime semantics it receives
when loaded by the engine today.

Runtime-owned replacement behavior is acceptable only at the bootstrap boundary
or for runtime-private plumbing such as status/logging. Mod Relay should
not become an ongoing compatibility shim that reimplements Darktide's Lua
runtime or patch-fixes missing behavior for each mod.

### Bootstrap boundary

The shell's C bootstrap is responsible for:

- finding/capturing the live Lua state at the correct lifecycle point;
- getting the staged runtime patch into that state without the bundle database;
- handing off to staged loader/DMF Lua in an engine-equivalent environment.

After that handoff, loader/DMF-visible surfaces such as `require`, `io`,
`loadstring`, globals, and loader hooks come from the engine path or a
behaviorally equivalent wrapper around it — not from independent C
reimplementations.

### Engine-equivalent loader path

In the current community toolchain, `patch_999` is file-based only for the
initial bootstrap: its trampoline reads `./mod_loader` from disk and executes it
with `loadstring`. After that, `mod_loader` runs inside the game's normal Lua
startup path and captures the engine-visible Lua facilities that loader/DMF expect.

**This mechanism is proven.** A chunk injected at `lua_pcall` #1 (the first
script execution after `luaL_openlibs`, while `io`/`loadstring` are still in
the globals) sees the engine's real facilities and can `io.open` + `loadstring`
staged Lua — validated end-to-end in the live game (the production trampoline
loads + runs staged Lua successfully). The engine removes `io`/`loadstring` by
~pcall#10, so the trampoline runs in the pcall#1 → pcall#10 window and captures
them first. There is no `setfenv` sandbox at pcall#1 (chunk env = globals
table). The mod loader then runs in engine-context, captures
`io`/`loadstring`/`require` into the `Mods` table, and defers `CLASS`/`Managers`
work (same model as the existing community `mod_loader`).

### `Mods.original_require`

The runtime must provide DMF with a `Mods.original_require` function compatible
with the loader DMF expects. In the current toolchain, `mod_loader` preserves the
engine's real `require` as `Mods.original_require`; DMF's require module builds
tracking (`Mods.require_store`, `hook_require`) on top of that original function.

Mod Relay preserves this behavior. `Mods.original_require` is the engine's
original `require` or a behaviorally equivalent wrapper around it. It is not a
staging-only file loader. Runtime-owned file loading may exist for bootstrap or
private helper paths, but not as the production implementation of
`Mods.original_require` observed by loader/DMF/mod code.

### `Mods.lua.io`

The runtime must provide the `Mods.lua.io` surface that DMF uses for file access.
DMF's `core/io.lua` deep-copies `Mods.lua.io` at init and uses the familiar Lua
file API (`io.open`, file `:read("*all")`, `:lines()`, `:close()`, `io.close`)
for its debug modules. Mod Relay therefore captures the engine-visible
Lua `io` table into `Mods.lua.io` before it is stripped.

Mod Relay preserves this behavior. `Mods.lua.io` is the engine-visible Lua
`io` table or a behaviorally equivalent engine wrapper. A C/Win32 file API may
exist for the bootstrap or runtime-private helpers, but not as the
loader/DMF-visible production replacement for Lua `io`.

## Out of scope for the Relay runtime

- **Dependency resolution / load-order computation** — not the runtime's job
  (you, or the app driving the launcher, author `mods.lst`); the Relay runtime
  bootstraps the staged mod loader entry point, and the mod loader reads the
  load order authoritatively (DMF does not).
- **Profile / staging-dir management** — not the runtime's concern; handle it
  in whatever wraps the launcher (a mod manager like Mod Curator, a script,
  or by hand).

## Build + test

See `AGENTS.md` (agent ops) and `docs/architecture/README.md` (test strategy):
MinGW + MSVC; the `test-hooks` feature; `make build/check/test` + the clippy
gate.
